# Pong_Game_with_Java

This is a simple pong game that I made just for fun with Java and I really liked the results!

Each file was made for an element of the game, so we have the ball and both players. Game file is where the main code is and the Points file is there to print the points and the winner on the screen.

The commands are simple, you have to press Enter to start, then you use the keyboard to move the players. The blue player is moved by the left and right keys, while the red one is moved by A and D keys.
